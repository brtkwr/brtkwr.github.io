# About Me

I'm Bharat (although I usually go by `brtkwr` handle on the tinternet). I've lived in [Bristol][bristol] since 2012 - a city I love love love!

## Current Life

My family doubled in size with the arrival of twins at the end of 2019. While the pandemic brought many challenges, it helped me find a better work-life balance. Though I miss my commute-time podcasts, I now enjoy them during pram walks with the children.

I'm passionate about:

- Societal impact of technology
- Discovering vegan cuisine
- Exploring coffee shops
- Attending hackathons and meetups
- Collaborating on coding projects (e.g. [fast.ai][fastai], [smart contracts][strangelabs], etc.)

## Professional Journey

## Travel Adventures

- 2023: The four of us went on a 3 month tour of Asia again. Again after a family visit to Nepal for 3 weeks, we stayed in Thailand for 6 weeks (Phuket and Koh Lanta), followed by Kuala Lumpur for a week and Sri Lanka for 6 weeks where we were also joined by family and friends. I also had the chance to work remotely from Thailand and Sri Lanka and the time zone difference worked out really well as I was doing things with the children in the morning and starting work in the afternoon.
- 2017: Kyla and I embarked on a 6-month journey through Asia, exploring Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and China. You can view our adventures in our [travel photos][kylaandbharatinasia].

## Educational Background

- 2007-2009: A-levels at Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone
- 2003-2007: GCSEs at Carr Hill High School, Kirkham

## Early Life

My journey began in [Burtibang][burtibang], western Nepal, where I was born in 1989. As the son of a [Brigade of Gurkhas][gurkhas] serviceman, my early years were quite mobile:

- 1991-1994: Lived in Hong Kong with my parents (where my brother was born)
- 1995-2003: Resided in [Kathmandu Valley][kunwar-bhawan], partly with family and later at boarding school
- 2003: Reunited with family in the UK
