# About Me

I'm Bharat (although I usually go by `brtkwr` handle on the tinternet). I've lived in [Bristol][bristol] since 2012 - a city I love love love!

My family doubled in size with the arrival of twins at the end of 2019. While the pandemic brought many challenges, it helped me find a better work-life balance. Though I miss my commute-time podcasts, I now enjoy them during pram walks with the children.

I'm passionate about:

- Societal impact of technology
- Discovering vegan cuisine
- Exploring coffee shops
- Attending hackathons and meetups
- Collaborating on coding projects (e.g. [fast.ai][fastai], [smart contracts][strangelabs], etc.)

## Professional Journey

- 2016 - 2017: Research Software Engineer at [Airbus][agi]. I had the opportunity to apply [deep reinforcement learning][drl] to optimize interactions between connected autonomous vehicles as part of a [Flourish][flourish] consortium project.
- 2018 - 2021: Software Engineer at [StackHPC][stackhpc] where I learnt about open source collaboration and HPC for research computing using [OpenStack][openstack] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes].
- 2021 - Present: Senior Software Engineer at [Two][two], a company with a mission to solve cash flow issues for B2B transactions.

## Educational Trajectory

- 2003 - 2007: GCSEs at Carr Hill High School, Kirkham
- 2007 - 2009: A-levels at Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone
- 2008 - 2012: Master's degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering at [University of Bath][6east]
- 2012 - 2017: PhD in Engineering at [University of Bristol][buncaer] under supervision of Anders Johansson and Filippo Simini with a focus on [mass evacuation modelling][massevac]. My research is available [here][scholar].

## Life Adventures

- 2017: Kyla and I embarked on a 6-month journey through Asia, exploring Nepal, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and China. You can view our adventures in our [travel photos][kylaandbharatinasia].
- 2023: The four of us went on a 3 month tour of Asia again. Again after a family visit to Nepal for 3 weeks, we stayed in Thailand for 6 weeks (Phuket and Koh Lanta), followed by Kuala Lumpur for a week and Sri Lanka for 6 weeks where we were also joined by family and friends. I also had the chance to work remotely from Thailand and Sri Lanka and the time zone difference worked out really well as I was doing things with the children in the morning and starting work in the afternoon.

## Early Life

My journey began in [Burtibang][burtibang], western Nepal, where I was born in 1989. As the son of a [Brigade of Gurkhas][gurkhas] serviceman, my early years were quite mobile:

- 1991 - 1994: Lived in Hong Kong with my parents (where my brother was born)
- 1995 - 2003: Resided in [Kathmandu Valley][kunwar-bhawan], partly with family and later at boarding school
- 2003 - 2005: Reunited with family in the UK (Blackpool)
- 2005 - 2008: Lived in Folkestone, Kent
- 2009 - 2012: Studied in Bath, Somerset
- 2012 - Present: Moved to Bristol, Avon and stayed put!
